## User journey
Here i describe a high-level user journey of each use case, highlighting the K protocol specifications, which define how the information have to be exchnaged in Kaspa network, included in transaction payload, etc.

**Legend:**
  ✅ Features already implemented, with established K protocol definition.
  ❌ Features not yet implemented; K protocol definition could change.

### ✅  User presentation to the other network users
- User A activates the app for the first time and creates its own "K identity" (represented by a unique pair of private and public keys);
- This identity is unique in the whole network and represent only this specific user;
- User A locally backup the required data to restore its account, in case he needs to use it on another clinet;
- After creating its identity, User A fund its account by sending a small amount of KAS from his personal wallet, in order to pay for fees;
- User A broadcast the first message in K network, by informing everyone about his skills, interest, topics of choice, etc; in this way, he's promoting its new presence on the network;
- User A can repeat this broadcast overtime, to show his constant presence and desire to get connected to other users.
